# Appearance-matching
End goal is a program that takes two photo inputs (portrait photo, body shot) and outputs similar-looking people from a large dataset. Would be very useful for stylistic decisions (hairstyles, clothing styles) to be able to see what looks good on people with your hair type, body type, face shape, etc.
First step was creating a PCA-based face-matching program to get a solid understanding of a commonly used tool.
